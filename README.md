![Project - HF prediction ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76844909/148222200-a2b4c2f9-d016-4280-9262-5186a7c0ac58.jpg)


Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 11 features that can be used to predict a possible heart disease.
People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.


#Requirements
A group of clinical Researchers on a hospital started a research about the diagnostic measurements that predict heart failure.
- Each patient that is recorded at patients has an ID, Name, Age, Sex, Phones, Date and time of entering leaving hospital, History of exercise angina,  Heart failure result. 
- Each blood sample the taken from specific patient has ID,  Cholesterol result, FBS result and each patient may have more than one blood sample.
- Vital measurements contain unique value, BR, Max HR.
- Vital Signs are measured for each patient  one or many times during his stay in the hospital.
- Each Resting ECG measurement  result has an ID, Name that the patient may be diagnosed of.
- Each chest pain type has a unique ID and name that the patient may be suffer from one of them at a time.
- Each ST- Slop has and ID and the slope type that is observed from the ECG of the patient.

#More Details
I created this project based on a dataset from kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction
and performed some coomplicated queries on this database.
